Hi, I'm Carla N. Pérez, a Software Engineer specializing in DevOps and CI/CD pipeline orchestration. I'm currently completing my Master's degree in Industrial Engineering, where I focus on time series analysis and forecasting. I also have great interest in the intersection of technology and ethical considerations in AI systems.

### My Interests

I'm passionate about building robust software systems while ensuring that AI and machine learning technologies are developed and deployed ethically. I believe that as engineers, we have a responsibility to consider the broader impact of the systems we create.
