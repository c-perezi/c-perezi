# Credits

This template was not made *entirely* from scratch. I'd like to give special thanks to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from whom I've taken several ideas initially.

I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.
